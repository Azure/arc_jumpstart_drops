## Branch guidance

The Arc Jumpstart Drops repository handles branching similarly to the other Arc Jumpstart [repositories](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_docs). Two primary branches are maintained, each one attached to a specific website slot (prod/canary). 

The following branches are currently maintained:

| Branch                                                       | Website                    | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [main](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_drops/) (primary)               | https://jumpstart.azure.com/azure_jumpstart_drops      | Latest Arc Jumpstart public website. This is the latest documentation and Drops available in the deployed to the production slot. |
| [canary](https://github.com/Azure/arc_jumpstart_drops/tree/canary) (preview) | https://preview.jumpstart.azure.com/azure_jumpstart_drops | Pre-release documentation. Document and Drops updates should be merged to the canary branch for preview validation before merging to the main branch. |
