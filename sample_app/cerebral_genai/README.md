### Communication Flow

The decision tree for "Cerebral" illustrates the AI-driven process from user query to response generation, integrating both data retrieval and document look-up functionalities. Below is a breakdown of each step in the data flow:

- **User Prompt**:
  
  The process begins when a user inputs a prompt, such as "Show me the oil temperature in the past 15 minutes." This prompt initiates the decision-making process within the system.

- **Query Classification Using Azure Open AI**:
  
  The user's prompt is sent to Azure Open AI for query classification. Azure Open AI evaluates the content and context of the query to determine whether the user is requesting real-time data or looking for information contained in documents.

- **Classification**:
  
  Based on Azure Open AI's analysis, the query is classified into one of two paths:
    - Data-related queries are directed towards executing database queries.
    - Document-related queries proceed towards searching within a vector database.

- **Execution Paths**:
  - **Data Path**:
    - **InfluxDB Query Execution**: If the query is classified as data-related, the user's prompt is converted into a specific query for InfluxDB, which retrieves time-series data relevant to the query.
    - **Data Interpretation and Analysis**: The retrieved data is then analyzed, and the system generates automated recommendations or insights based on the data.
  - **Document Path**:
    - **VectorDB Query Execution**: For document-related queries, the system translates the prompt into a search query for a chroma vector database. This database contains indexed manuals and troubleshooting guides.
    - **LLM Vector Search Integration**: The results from the vector database are integrated with the user's query to compile a comprehensive response detailing the information or steps required.

- **Backend Processing on the Edge**:
  
  Queries are processed on backend systems located on the Edge, utilizing Azure IoT MQ for communication and executing necessary data queries or document retrievals.

- **Response Generation**:
  - **Dynamic HTML Response**: For both paths, the final step involves generating a dynamic HTML response that presents the information. For data queries, this may include graphs and tables displaying trends or specific data points. For document queries, this might consist of structured information or steps derived from the manuals.

- **Display to User**:
  
  The generated response is displayed to the user, providing them with either the requested data visualized effectively or a well-structured answer from the document search, enabling them to make informed decisions or perform tasks more efficiently.

This communication flow highlights "Cerebral's" capability to handle diverse user requests by leveraging advanced AI classification and integration of multiple data sources, enhancing the decision-making and troubleshooting capabilities at Contoso Motors.
