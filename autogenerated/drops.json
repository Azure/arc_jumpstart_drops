The tool can help on machine troubleshooting on-site and more use cases. In this sample, we demonstrate how to use the tool as industry copilot to help people on construction site quickly troubleshoot the excavators. During the construction operation, when the excavators is broken, it is usually time-consuming for the staff on site to find the solution from the technical manual and the past troubleshooting logs or contact technical specialist for help. The edge multi-modal RAG tool serves as the industry copilot helping the operator staff to quickly fix the problems. The solution is independent from cloud services, and can be deployed to the edge machine.",
