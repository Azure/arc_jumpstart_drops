    "Description": "Multimodal RAG on Edge is a tool to perform multi-modal searches, which allows image, text, or combination of both as the input query, within files using a multi-modal vector search engine, Marqo, and to generate a readable response based on the search result with LLAVA. The tool can help on machine troubleshooting on-site and more use cases. In this sample, we demonstrate how to use the tool as industry copilot to help people on construction site quickly troubleshoot the excavators. During the construction operation, when the excavators is broken, it is usually time-consuming for the staff on site to find the solution from the technical manual and the past troubleshooting logs or contact technical specialist for help. The edge multi-modal RAG tool serves as the industry copilot helping the operator staff to quickly fix the problems. The solution is independent from cloud services, and can be deployed to the edge machine.",

    "Description": "The Image-Based Video Search sample application enables users to search live or recorded camera feeds by providing an image and viewing matching objects with location, timestamp, and confidence scores. This AI-powered solution combines edge microservices for video ingestion, object detection, feature extraction, and vector-based search. The workflow processes video streams through Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server and MediaMTX, extracts features using machine learning models, stores vector embeddings in MilvusDB, and provides intelligent search capabilities. Users can upload images or capture frames from video to find similar objects across large video datasets.",
