    "Title": "Azure IoT Operations Observability GitOps",
    "Summary": "This Jumpstart Drop sets up Azure IoT Operations with OpenTelemetry and local observability visualization using Flux GitOps. It uses a Visual Studio Code dev container and K3D cluster for local monitoring of Azure IoT Operations components.",
    "Description": "In this sample, a Visual Studio Code dev container is used as the developer sandbox to leverage a local K3D cluster, initialize Azure resources and install a baseline set of Azure IoT Operations' components. The objective is to illustrate how to setup observability to be able to locally visualize health of the cluster and Azure IoT Operations' components. This repository is particularly useful for those interested in edge-based visualization. Please check formal Azure IoT Operations documentation if you are looking for a default observability setup and wish to analyze observability data using Azure Monitor",
