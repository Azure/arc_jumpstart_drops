    "Description": "This Jumpstart Drop provides an Azure Monitor workbook that is intended to provide a single pane of glass for monitoring and reporting on Arc resources. Using Azure's management and operations tools in hybrid, multi-cloud and edge deployments provides the consistency needed to manage each environment through a common set of governance and operations management practices. The Azure Monitor workbook acts as a flexible canvas for data analysis and visualization in the Azure portal, gathering information from several data sources and combining them into an integrated interactive experience.",
