    "Title": "Simulate an ONVIF camera with RTSP",
    "Summary": "This Jumpstart Drop provides a way to simulate an ONVIF camera and serve an RTSP feed with an MP4 file. It is particularly useful for testing and development purposes when you need to simulate a camera feed in a Docker/Kubernetes environment.",
    "Description": "This project provides a set of tools and instructions for mocking an ONVIF-compliant IP camera and passing an RTSP stream to simulate a live video stream. It can be run as a Docker container or built locally. Users can also mount a volume or folder with the container to simulate the RTSP camera with the mounted video file.",
