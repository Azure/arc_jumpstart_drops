  "Title": "Azure Arc with AMPLS & Private Link",
  "Summary": "This Jumpstart Drop deploys a secure hybrid infrastructure using Azure Arc and Azure Monitor Private Link Scopes (AMPLS), with Terraform.",
  "Description": "This Jumpstart Drop showcases how to integrate Azure Arc-enabled servers with Azure Monitor using AMPLS and Private Link for secure traffic flow. It simulates an on-premises environment connected to Azure through a VNet-to-VNet VPN Gateway. A Windows Server VM is onboarded to Azure Arc using a Custom Script Extension. Log and metrics traffic is routed privately through AMPLS with Private DNS Zones, and ingested into a Log Analytics workspace. Azure Bastion provides secure remote desktop access. The deployment is fully automated using Terraform and aligns with Azure Arc Jumpstart best practices.",
