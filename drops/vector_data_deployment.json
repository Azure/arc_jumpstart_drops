  "Title": "Vector Data Deployment to Multiple Edge Vector DBs",
  "Summary": "This Drop provides a vector data deployment pattern with Azure Arc & Edge Storage Accelerator via deploying the centralized vector data from cloud to synchronize edge vector DBs across multiple edge machines.",
  "Description": "This Jumpstart Drop provides a vector data deployment pattern that hosting a vector DB in the cloud as a central hub for RAG indexing, and deploying vector data to synchronize edge vector DBs across multiple edge machines for your edge RAG application. This approach ensures that RAG-on-Edge systems operate efficiently with up-to-date vector data content. It also offers an efficient method to restore vector DB data on edge machines in case of data loss.",
