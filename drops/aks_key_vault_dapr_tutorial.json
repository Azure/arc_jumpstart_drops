  "Description": "Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is a versatile and event-driven runtime that simplifies the development of resilient, stateless, and stateful applications for both cloud and edge environments. It embraces the diversity of programming languages and developer frameworks, providing a seamless experience regardless of your preferences. Dapr encapsulates the best practices for building microservices into a set of open and independent APIs known as building blocks. These building blocks enable developers to build portable applications using their preferred language and framework. They are completely independent from each other, allowing flexibility and freedom of choice.Dapr offers a built-in secrets building block that makes it easier for developers to consume application secrets from a secret store such as Azure Key Vault, AWS Secret Manager, Google Key Management, and HashiCorp Vault.",
